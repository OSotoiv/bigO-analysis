# Simplifying Expressions
### Simplify the following big O expressions as much as possible:
    O(n + 10)
    The expression "O(n + 10)" is a big O notation used in computer science to describe the asymptotic upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm.

    In this case, the "n" term represents the size of the input, and the "+ 10" term is a constant factor added to it. However, since the constant factor does not grow as the input size increases, it does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm.

    Therefore, we can simplify "O(n + 10)" to "O(n)", which means that the time complexity of the algorithm is proportional to the size of the input. This is a linear time complexity, which is generally considered to be an efficient algorithm.
#
    O(100 * n)
    O(100 * n) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    In this case, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input, since the coefficient 100 is a constant and does not affect the growth rate of the function. Therefore, we can simplify O(100 * n) to O(n) and say that the algorithm has a linear time complexity.

    This means that as the size of the input (n) increases, the time taken by the algorithm will increase linearly. For example, if n doubles, the time taken by the algorithm will also double.
#
    O(25)
    O(25) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    In this case, O(25) means that the time complexity of the algorithm is constant and does not depend on the size of the input. This is because the constant value 25 does not change as the size of the input changes.

    Therefore, we can say that the algorithm has a constant time complexity of O(1). This means that the time taken by the algorithm remains the same regardless of the size of the input.
#
    O(n^2 + n^3)
    O(n^2 + n^3) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    In this case, we can simplify the expression by taking the highest order term, which is n^3. Therefore, we can simplify O(n^2 + n^3) to O(n^3). This means that the time complexity of the algorithm grows at a rate proportional to n^3 as the size of the input increases.

    This indicates that the algorithm has a cubic time complexity, which means that the time taken by the algorithm increases rapidly as the size of the input grows. For example, if the size of the input doubles, the time taken by the algorithm increases by a factor of 8 (2^3).
#
    O(n + n + n + n)
    O(n + n + n + n) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    We can simplify this expression by combining the terms, which gives us 4n. Therefore, we can simplify O(n + n + n + n) to O(4n).

    However, in Big O notation, we drop the constant factor, which means that we can further simplify this expression to O(n). This means that the time complexity of the algorithm grows linearly with respect to the size of the input.

    In other words, as the size of the input (n) increases, the time taken by the algorithm will increase proportionally. For example, if the size of the input doubles, the time taken by the algorithm will also double.
#
    O(1000 * log(n) + n)
    O(1000 * log(n) + n) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    The term 1000 * log(n) grows more slowly than n, so as n becomes very large, the contribution of 1000 * log(n) to the overall time complexity becomes negligible. Therefore, we can simplify O(1000 * log(n) + n) to O(n).

    This means that the time complexity of the algorithm grows linearly with respect to the size of the input. As the size of the input (n) increases, the time taken by the algorithm will increase proportionally. For example, if the size of the input doubles, the time taken by the algorithm will also double.

    Note that the term 1000 * log(n) still has an impact on the running time of the algorithm, but its contribution becomes less significant as the size of the input grows larger.
#
    O(1000 * n * log(n) + n)
    O(1000 * n * log(n) + n) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    The term 1000 * n * log(n) grows faster than n, so as n becomes very large, the contribution of n to the overall time complexity becomes negligible compared to 1000 * n * log(n). Therefore, we can simplify O(1000 * n * log(n) + n) to O(1000 * n * log(n)).

    This means that the time complexity of the algorithm grows at a rate proportional to 1000 * n * log(n) as the size of the input increases. This indicates that the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log(n)).

    This means that the time taken by the algorithm will increase faster than linearly as the size of the input grows. For example, if the size of the input doubles, the time taken by the algorithm may increase by more than double. However, the algorithm still has a better time complexity than O(n^2) and is considered to be more efficient than algorithms with a quadratic time complexity.
#
    O(2^n + n^2)
    O(2^n + n^2) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    The term 2^n grows much faster than n^2, so as n becomes very large, the contribution of n^2 to the overall time complexity becomes negligible compared to 2^n. Therefore, we can simplify O(2^n + n^2) to O(2^n).

    This means that the time complexity of the algorithm grows at an exponential rate with respect to the size of the input. As the size of the input (n) increases, the time taken by the algorithm will increase exponentially. For example, if the size of the input doubles, the time taken by the algorithm may increase by a factor of four (2^2).

    Algorithms with exponential time complexity are generally considered to be very inefficient for large inputs, as they can become very slow very quickly. Therefore, it is important to try to find more efficient algorithms for problems with exponential time complexity.
#
    O(5 + 3 + 1)
    O(5 + 3 + 1) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    In this case, the expression represents a constant amount of work, since the values 5, 3, and 1 do not depend on the size of the input. Therefore, we can simplify O(5 + 3 + 1) to O(1).

    This means that the time complexity of the algorithm is constant and does not depend on the size of the input. The time taken by the algorithm will remain the same regardless of the size of the input.

    In other words, the algorithm takes a fixed amount of time to run, regardless of the size of the input.
#
    O(n + n^(1/2) + n^2 + n * log(n)^10)
    O(n + n^(1/2) + n^2 + n * log(n)^10) is an expression in Big O notation that describes the time complexity of an algorithm. The "O" stands for "order of" and the expression inside the parentheses describes how the time complexity grows as the size of the input (n) grows.

    To simplify this expression, we need to identify the term with the highest order of growth. The term n * log(n)^10 grows more slowly than n^2, but faster than n^(1/2). So as n becomes very large, the contributions of n^(1/2), n, and n^2 to the overall time complexity become negligible compared to n * log(n)^10. Therefore, we can simplify O(n + n^(1/2) + n^2 + n * log(n)^10) to O(n * log(n)^10).

    This means that the time complexity of the algorithm grows at a rate proportional to n * log(n)^10 as the size of the input increases. This indicates that the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log(n)^10).

    This means that the time taken by the algorithm will increase faster than linearly as the size of the input grows, but more slowly than algorithms with quadratic or higher time complexity. For example, if the size of the input doubles, the time taken by the algorithm may increase by more than double, but less than four times.
